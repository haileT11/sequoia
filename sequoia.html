    <h1>Giant Sequoia</h1>
    <hr>

    <p><i>Sequoiadendron giganteum</i> (giant sequoia; also known as giant redwood, 
    Sierra redwood, Sierran redwood,Wellingtonia or simply bigh tree-a nickname also used by John Muir<sup>[2]</sup>)
    is the sole living species in the genus Sequoiadendron, and one of three species of coniferous trees known as redwoods.</p>

   <h2> My Description</h2>
  <hr>
   <p>Giant Sequoia specimens are the most massive individual trees in the world.
    They grow to an average height of 50-85 m (164-279 ft) with trunk diameters
    ranging from 6-8 m (20-26 ft). Record trees have been measured at 94.8 m (311 ft) tall. 
    The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General Grant tree at 8.8m (28.9 ft)</p>
    
    <p>The oldest known giant sequoia is 3,500 year old based o dendrochronlolgy. Gient sequoias are among the oldest living organisms on earth. Giant Sequoia bark 
        is fibrous, furrowed, & may be 90 cm (3ft) thick at the base of columnar trunk. The  bark provides significant protection from fire damage.
        The leaves are evergreen, awl-shaped, 3-6mm (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> - <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>in) long, & arranged sprially on the shoots. </p>

        <p>Jonh muir wrote of the species in about 1870. </p>
            <p><blockquoute>" do behold the king in his glory, king sequoia! behold! behold! seems all i can say. Some time ago i left all
            for sequoia & have been am at his feel, fasting & praying for light, for is he not the greatest light in the woods, in the wood, in the world? where
        are such columes of sunshine, tagible, acessible, terrestrialized?" </blockquoute> </p>

    <p>
    Between 2014 and 2016, it is claimed that specimens of coast redwood were found to have greater trunk diameters than all known 
    giant sequoias - though this has not been independently verified or affirmed in any academic literature.<sup>[9]</sup> The trunks of coast 
    redwoods taper at lower heights than those of giant sequoias which have more columnar trunks that maintain larger 
    diameters to greater heights.</p>

    <h2>Biology</h2>
    <p>Because of its size, the tree has been studied for its water pull. Water from the roots can be pushed up only a few meters by osmotic pressure but 
    can reach extreme height by using a system of branching capillarity (capillary action) in the tree's xylem (the water tubules) and sub-pressure from
    evaporating water at the leaves. <sup>[10]</sup> Sequoias supplement water from the soil with fog, taken up through air roots, at heights to where the root water cannot be pulled</p>

    <h2>Cultivation</h2>
    <p>Giant sequoia is avery popular ornamental tree in many areas. It is successfully grown in most of western and southern Europe, the Pacific Northwest of North America north to southwest
    British Columbia, the southern Uninted States, southeast Australia.
    New Zealand and central-southern chile. It is also grown, though less successfully, in parts of eastern North America.</p>

    <h3>United States and Canada</h3>
    

    Giant sequoias are grown successfully in the Pacific Northwest and southern US, and less successfully in eastern North America. Giant sequouia cultivation is very successful in the Pacific northwest
    from western Oregon north to southwest British Columbia, with fast growth rates. In Washington and Oregon, it is common to find giant sequoias that have been successfully planted in both urban and rural areas. 
    In the Seattle are, large specimens exceeding 90 ft (27) are fairly common and exist in several city parks and many private yards(especially east Seattle including Capitol Hill, Washington Park, & Leschi/Madrona, 
    as well as Tacoma's Jefferson Park).

    <h2>New Zealand</h2>
    Several impressive specimens of Sequoiadendron gigantecum can be found in the South Island of New Zealand. Notabel examples include a set of trees in a public park of Picton, as well as robust specimens in the 
    public and botanical parks of christchurch and Queenstown There are also several in private gardens in Wanka. There is also a tree at rangiora High School, which was plated for queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee and 
    is thus over 125 years old.
